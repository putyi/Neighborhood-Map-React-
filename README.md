#### _Project - Neighborhood_Map(React)_

## Project Overview:

For the **Neighborhood Map (React)** project, I was given the task to create a new react app with a map containing data from third party API. I used **Foursquare** and **Google Maps API**. The main functionalities are built on synchronizing map markers with a list of venues. If a venue from the list is hovered on, the corresponding marker is shown on the map. Clickicg a marker shows the restaurants name, clicking an item from the list opens a new page showing extra (if available) information about it. I've also included a filter for the list which matces the string with venues names and updates the markes and the list. The app is responsive, it's features work properly on mobile devices too.
